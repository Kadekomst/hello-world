# hello-world
My first repository

Hi everyone!

I am Kadekomst and it's an important moment. Very important moment. I've created my first repository on GitHub. But...Microsoft bought GitHub several days ago...By the way, it actually doesn't matter. I like GitHub. GITLAB SUCKS AHAHA! 

So...this is the first version of my repository. Moreover, I don't actually know what project it it 'cuz I haven't created it yet :)
